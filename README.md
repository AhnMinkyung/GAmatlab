# GAmatlab
Matlab codes of Genetic Algorithm.

I used 5 single classifiers, DT, kNN, QDA, RF, and SVM.
The number of input variables is 20.
10-fold cross validation.
The number of repetitions is 1000 generations.
The cross rate is 0.7 and the mutation rate is 0.001.

Fitness function is max of accuracy here.

I used roulette wheel method.
